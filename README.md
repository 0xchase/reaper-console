# Reaper Console

Reaper console plugin to control reaper via a cli and to interface with my AI projects.

### Navigation commands
 - tn <preset> (new track)
 - td (delete track)
 - s <track:section> (seek to a track and song section)
 - ma <length> (midi clip add, certain length)

### AI Interface
 - Window for generative track scripting, each time you run, generates a new project, can generate arbitrary length also
